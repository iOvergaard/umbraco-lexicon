# Lexicon - Umbraco Package

## Project Overview

**Lexicon** is an Umbraco community package that restores dictionary-based backoffice localization for Umbraco 14 and newer versions.

## Background

- Dictionary-based backoffice localization was a built-in feature in Umbraco 13 and earlier
- This functionality was removed in Umbraco 14+
- **Lexicon** reintroduces this capability for users who need it on modern versions

## Package Purpose

Enable developers and content editors to localize the Umbraco backoffice using dictionary items, providing flexibility for multi-language content management environments.

## Naming

- **Package name:** Lexicon
- **Rationale:** Clean, memorable, directly communicates dictionary/language management focus. Fits well within Umbraco marketplace naming conventions (alongside packages like Skybrud Redirects, Page Guard, uSync.Complete)
- **NuGet namespace:** `umbraco.community.lexicon` (or similar following Umbraco community conventions)

## Key Design Considerations

- Compatibility with Umbraco 14+
- Dictionary item integration
- Backoffice UI localization
- Developer-friendly API
